# Weekend Movie Sagas App

## Description

_Duration: 2 days_

This is a movie list app that shows a selection of movies to choose from.  When a user clicks on a movie poster, they can view more detailed info about the specific movie.


### Prerequisites


## Installation

1. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`.
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_movies_weekend` database
3. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
4. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
5. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
6. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
7. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

2.  Click on a movie to view details about the movie
